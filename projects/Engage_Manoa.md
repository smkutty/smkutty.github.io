## Significance and Solution
<p>The University of Hawaii at Manoa offers a multitude of clubs and organizations that are student led and operated. Each semester a festive club drive takes place at the well-known Campus Center, giving these groups a chance to advertise their activities and garner interest. However, after this event, there is not much word about what the campus has to offer for extracurriculars. For this reason, my project partners and I create a website application that allows students to find clubs based on their academic interests and create a list of their own clubs they would like to join. Additionally, students can create administrative accounts that allow them to create new clubs to advertise on the website.</p>
