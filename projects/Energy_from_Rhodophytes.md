<h2>A study of anaerobic digestion on three different invasive species of red algae: Gracilaria salicornia, Kappaphycus spinosum, and Eucheuma spinosum</h2>

## ABSTRACT

<p>This project is stage one of a larger investigation of using rhodophytes (red algae) as a source of biomass. Algae is very commonly used to produce ethanol, which is liquid fuel; however in this project, I will be taking a less common route by implementing algae to create biogas using anaerobic digestion. In stage one of this project, three types of red algae were tested: Gracilaria salicornia, Kappaphycus spinosum, and Eucheuma spinosum. Using the serum bottle method, two things were tested 1) how effective untreated red algae is in producing biogas and 2) if there was a significant difference in biogas production among the three types. Because the algae will be untreated, I did not expect the algae to produce much methane, but I also did not expect there to be much of a difference between the three species since they have similar nutrient contents.</p>
<p>The biomass and cow dung were put into serum bottles and kept in an incubator at 37 degrees Celsius. Over a period of time, the gas was measured using the water displacement method and a gas chromatograph (GC). The final results are as follows: Gracilaria s. produced 47.189 mL of methane, Kappaphycus sp. produced 123.987 mL, and Eucheuma sp. produced 152.073 mL. Based on these results, we can see that my first hypothesis was correct because the algae did not produce a large amount of methane; however, my second hypothesis was proved wrong because there was a significant different among the three species. To continue this project, a chemical analysis will be done on each of the three algae types to justify these results and to also determine how I can modify the biomass systems so that it will be more efficient. </p>
