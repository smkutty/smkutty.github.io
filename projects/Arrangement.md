<h2>For U</h2>
<h3>Arranged by Sreelakshmi Kutty</h3>

<p>Music has been a lifelong friend, and playing violin is and was equivalent to drinking water--necessary for optimal functionality. As senior year of highschool came running to a close, it only made sense that I put together an arrangement that described my class's journey. I chose songs that embodied the bittersweet emotions of saying goodbye to our class of 24 and sailing off to new adventures. </p>
