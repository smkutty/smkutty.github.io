# For U
<h3>Arranged by Sreelakshmi Kutty</h3>

<p>Music has been a lifelong friend, and playing violin is and was equivalent to drinking water--necessary for optimal functionality. As senior year of highschool came running to a close, it only made sense that I put together an arrangement that described my class's journey.

And not everyone was at the same skill level. Because of this, some parts had to be simplified and, and to make up for the loss of this portion, some parts were made to be more complex. But at the end of the day, the the arrangment turned out better than I had hoped.

## The Songwriting Software

I used a program called [Musescore](https://musescore.org/en) to develop the sheet music for the six parts. There were many hours of trial and error with other platforms, and this one turned out to be the best tool at the time. This particular software was more maleable than other programs I had tried and far more user friendly. Considering it is a free program that allows for the creation of
