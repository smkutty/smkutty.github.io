## Innovation and Creativity

Before entering the world of computer science, I put very little thought towards what it takes to build devices I used everyday, much less a website. However, it only took a few weeks into my first computer programming class in high school to realize how much work is necessary to build a simple program. Despite the difficulty and tediousness, we have reached monumental heights in terms of technological innovation. Things once thought impossible are now done on a daily basis. Understanding the work needed to develop the tools we depend on for survival is particularly important to me. I want to be able to extend my knowledge and experience with software engineering to improve the way lives are saved.

## Utilizing computer science in medicine

Millions of people have been saved due to the creation of a plethora of medical technology. The world of medicine itself could not be what it is today without all walks of engineering, which is why it is critical to recognize the relationship between technology and medicine--separate fields but symbiotic. After conversing with many health care specialsts from various departments, it has become more clear to me that there seems to be a gap between computer science and medicine. Being able to marry these two backgrounds together is ultimately my goal.

## It's the language of computer science

I am a bit of a language enthusiast. As I currently learn my fifth language, I realize how software engineering is an amalgamation of numeorus concepts I have encountered in classes prior. We are no longer focusing on one specific language. Instead, we are combining our experiences and knowledge to formulate solutions.
