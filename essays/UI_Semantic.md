# Why Reinvent the Wheel?

## Taking a look back...
My first experience with web designing was junior year of highschool, nearly five years ago. While in the midst of learning Java, I decided to dabble with HTML and CSS. At first it seemed like the most simple thing--just put some tags here and there with some formatting and voila you have yourself some code! I eventually created a website by adjusting the source code in a premade template from [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/). During that experience I realized that writing a few lines of code would not render a beautiful layout with perfect margins and borders. But it was not until I tried making a whole website from scratch that I realized how tedious it all is. An opportunity popped up in senior year to try and design a website for the Foster Botanical Gardens in downtown Honoulu. My project partner and I decided to first look at some premade website templates on common sites such as Weebly and Wix, but the options were so limited, so controlling the features were far too difficult. I decided, why not just try make it from scratch? The number of hours spent to try create a simple website with a menu bar, an internactive map, and event schedule proved to be far more arduous than I first imagined. Needless to say, the project did not get completed (thankfully it was not a serious business project), and the only lesson I learned was that making a website with just HTML and CSS is truly ineffecient. Enter UI Semantic..
