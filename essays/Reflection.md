## Development Environments

<p>When I first delved into the world of computer science and programming, I had no idea what one needed to create a program. My first ever programming assingment was to download a software called "Alice", and truth be told, I was incredibly confused as to why I would need this strange program. I was instructred to move blocks labelled with "if/else", "for", etc--basic functions that we built upon to create methods, objects, and so forth. However, I still did not understand how one would develop a software program by writing lines of code; after all, computer science was just about writing gibberish and spitting out some cool product, right? After a brief stint with "MIT Scratch", I finally approached a program called "Processing" in which I attempted line-by-line coding for the first time. I was surprised that the concept was the same as dragging blocks to create code. The only real difference was I was writing the code myself. I then reflected on "Alice" and how we could make different segments that called on other segments that called on other segments... esentially creating cohesive methods and functions. Alice was my first love affair with development environments, and it shaped my understanding of how software engineering works. Alice, MIT Scratch, and Processing were just different offices with specific layouts and tools that I could use to create all sorts of projects.</p>
<p>My journey through computer science has since taken me to other offices--drJava, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and the simplest of all, VI. In each case, it was like entering a brand new work space that had a desk and cabinets filled with a plethora of tools. It is important to note that some offices are better for certain projects. You wouldn't want to use an office that was designed to offer appliances to harvest organs when you want to make clay sculpture. Alice and IntelliJ are exmaples of "integrated development environments" (IDEs). IDEs enable "programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program" and "increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application..".</p>
