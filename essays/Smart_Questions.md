## Communication
<p>Software engineering is a collaborative experience, and in any such setting, communication is of utmost importance. This is particularly apparent in the current work atmosphere as many people have been forced to work remotely, so relaying information both effectively and efficiently has never been more crucial. The ability to ask questions is often overlooked when it comes to communication. Eric Raymond provides a detailed analysis on the art of asking questions in his essay "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way". Raymond lays out a general checklist of concepts to consider when asking questions in a technological environment and provides a number of "good" and "bad" examples. His checklist is particularly applicable in a written format such as emails or team chats, both popular methods of communication in group work. </p>
<p>As someone who provides tech support for a job, I know firsthand how important a question can be. What follows the cordial greeting when answering the phone is always a hit or miss. Sometimes it's a well explained issued, but more often than not, it's a vague string words to deciphered, which leads to a tedious game of 20 questions to ascertain the situation. This additional step of having to elucidate the issue elongates the process of providing assistance. Now of course we do not expect these users to be experts and asking questions of clarification is a part of this job, but one can at least hope for some basic information besides "I need help with my computer".</p>

## A Smart Example
<p>Here we have an example of a well thought out question on StackOverflow--the programmer's hub for all things necessary.</p>

<p>Upon opening this link, we are presented with a highly organized question that includes some key qualities mentioned in Raymond's essay. First and foremost, the subject title is concise and provides important pieces of information--what they want to do and the language they are using. Instead of simply asking "how do I do 'this'?", the first portion of the question provides a very precise goal with stipulations. They then show their current strategy, the error message, and what they actually want to achieve. Because of this straightfoward message, Because of the straightforwardness and clarity of this proposition, other users were able to offer solutions without having to start a long thread. </p>

## A Not-so Smart Example
<p>Now here we have an example of a question that is not only hard to follow but is also rather vague</p>
