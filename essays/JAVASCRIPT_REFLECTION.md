After having experienced two immersive courses utilizing Java and C/C++, navigating the world of Javascript is certainly a change of pace and style. While both Java and C++ offer a powerful command over programming, the rules associated with these languages are stringent and vast, which makes writing code in these languages a tedious and arduous task. But suddenly I find myself forming programs with hardly any thought about regulations and feeling like I am cutting corners willy nilly. Javascript is the rebellious sibling of Java that, for all intents and purposes, does what it is supposed to but allows for numerous opportunities to streamline the overall process of coding.

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
