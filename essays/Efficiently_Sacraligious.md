<h2>Efficiently Sacraligious</h2>

<h4> Thomas Edison once said: <i> "Hell there are no rules here - we're trying to accomplish something" </i> </h4>

After having experienced two immersive courses utilizing Java and C/C++, navigating the world of Javascript is certainly a change of pace and style. While both Java and C++ offer a powerful command over programming, the rules associated with these languages are stringent and vast, which makes writing code in these languages a tedious and arduous task. But suddenly I find myself forming programs with hardly any thought about regulations and feeling like I am cutting corners willy nilly. Javascript is the rebellious sibling of Java that, for all intents and purposes, does what it is supposed to but allows for numerous opportunities to streamline the overall process of coding.

In an odd way, writing in Javascript almost feels sacrilegious--as if I am actively ignoring orders or purposely speaking with incorrect grammar. Simple concepts such as variables not having to be defined by type or functions not having to return items of the same type are still astounding to me. This simplicity of Javascript offers the chance to be more concerned with the product. Does the algorithm give us the expected results? Is the output sensible? These questions were usually an afterthought for me in my previous classes because I was far more concerned with my use of the language. While the output was definitely important, it was more difficult to put the solution in my head into the actual code. With Javascript, I find myself spitting out code more quickly and with less thought about any consequences.

From a software engineering perspective, Javascript is ideal for its purpose. You are given the ability to be more concerned with user interface, particularly with accessing information from the user and providing information back. The malleability of Javascript provides room for further simplifying code. With that said, Javascript should not be used outside its intent. It would be like using a plane to fly to the moon. 

When put to the test during a flash challenge of 15 minutes or less to write a predetermined program, Javascript is fantastic. The initial idea of this high pressure task was daunting, but after experiencing three cases so far, I am confident that it can become easier. However, becoming more knowledgeable with Javascript syntax and functions is essential. Building fluency in the language and strengthening my ability to develop solutions in the form of algorithms are the two most important keys to making these challenges less stressful. But despite the pressure, it is still enjoyable to work with a peer and formulate a game plan on how to tackle a problem. In this way we learn our strengths, our weaknesses, and utlimately how to communicate effectively. Real world experience--what a concept!
